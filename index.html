				<p>	I am a game developer, comic artist, and illustrator, who prioritizes narrative in my approach to medical and scientific communication. I was born in Monterrey, Mexico, and moved to Chicago to study Linguistics and Computer Science for my undergraduate degree. I have a Master's degree in Biomedical Visualization from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where I completed a thesis project on bilingual approaches to patient education for people with aphasia. I love working with researchers and educators, and delight in making science approachable to the public.  </p>

				<h2><a href = "./games.html">Game Design</a></h2>

		<p>I was born and raised in Mexico, so I am interested in scientific communication by and for audiences outside the United States, or by and for marginalized communities anywhere in the world - I recognize the financial strain represented by hiring an illustrator, and will always be flexible with pricing in these situations. </p>
